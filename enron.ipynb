    "The purpose of this project is to performing machine learning techniques by building an algorithm that can identify Enron employees who may have been involved in the company's fraud. A dataset containing information on various financial and email indicators of different Enron employees was used to help build the model. This includes features such as the employee name, salary, bonus, number of emails sent, and whether or not they are a POI (Person of Interest). The next step is to explore the dataset to look for any relationships or outliers between the data. For example, I found that there was a 'Total' column included in the data, as well as a datapoint called 'The Travel Agency in the Park'. These datapoints are irrelevant to our investigation as they are not Enron employees. Once the dataset has been cleaned for outliers, I was able to use the relevant features to help make predictions on the likelihood that a given employee was a POI."

    "My initial features list contained all 20 available features within the dataset. I also decided to create two additional features called 'percent_from_poi' and 'percent_to_poi' using the original data provided. These features represent the ratio between the number of emails received (sent) from a POI to the total number of emails received (sent). The idea behind this is that I would like to investigate whether employees are likely to be POI's themselves if they communicate frequently with other POI's. I then preprocessed my features list by optimizing feature selection and feature importance. I used SelectKBest to select the best K features, as well as MinMaxScaler to add weights to the remaining features. Preprocessing data in machine learning is an important step before picking an algorithm as it  reduces the processing time of the algorithms. For example, I noticed that using MinMaxScaler reduced the completion time of the support vector machine algorithm from several hours to several minutes. Another reason is that some features may not be relevant when making predictions, and can therefore be ignored."

This is an important step in the machine learning process as it will determine the results of the model. If not done properly, the algorithm may run the risk of over-fitting or under-fitting the data. This will cause the results from the training data to differ from the testing data. Fortunately, scikit-learn provides a class called GridSearchCV to help find the optimal parameters of the model. For the Decision Tree algorithm, I tested the 'criterion' parameters of 'gini' and 'entropy', as well as 'max_depth' of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. After simulating each of the possible parameters through brute force, GridSearchCV returned the optimal parameters to be 'criterion':'gini' and 'max_depth': 6."

We 'pretend' to not know the results of the test set, and compare predictions to actual results to measure the results. However, there is a risk of overfitting the data as knowledge about the test set can 'leak' into the model. To solve this problem, cross-validation may be used by splitting the test data into smaller subsets. After several rounds of validation, the average results are returned. For this project, I used Stratified Shuffle Split, which splits up a random portion of the data several times. "
