P6: Make Effective Data Visualization

Flight Delays Slopegraph
By Trevor Cook


Summary:
	This visualization compares the average minutes delayed per flight for various airlines. It is in the form of a slopegraph, where users can choose to compare two different years worth of data, and see how each airline has changed over this time frame.

Design:
	The design choices that I made throughout this process are the following:

	-Decrease the size of my graph so that the user does not have to scroll down the page.

	-Keep the design simple and neat, by only including elements that are necessary to the visualization. For example, align all text, titles, and numbers along an axis. Use grey colors for the lines, and have them stand out when hovered over (blue when the airline decreases in minutes delayed, and red when the airline increases).

	-Use responsive web design by adjusting the layout when being viewed on smaller screens.

	-Focus the readers' attention on a specific airline by coloring it in orange. I chose to highlight Hawaiian Airlines Inc. because it ranks as one of the lowest airlines in average minutes delayed per flight for the majority of the years in this dataset.


Feedback:
	I have received the following feedback on my visualization during different stages of its completion. Each comment was received from a different person.


	"The figure is huge, how about decreasing the size a bit so that it can show in one page without scrolling down?" - index_1.html

	"You should add a paragraph to the page that describes your graph." - index_1.html

	"The chart isn't in line with the text at the top of the page.(when viewed on a mobile phone)" - index_2.html

	"The only advice that I do have is to increase the size of the visualization, it will reduce the appearance of collisions to some extent." - index_2.html

	"the slope graph looks great but with so many year combinations it might be quite tricky to come to any definite conclusions. Depending on your chosen data story it might be an idea to highlight the relevant airline somehow so they stand out? An even jazzier approach would be to choose an airline from a select box and that would then be highlighted but that is quite a technical challenge!", "how about a different colour for up and down?"- index_submission_1.html
